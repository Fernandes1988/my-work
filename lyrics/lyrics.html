        Verse 1
        You call me out upon the waters
        The great unknown where feet may fail
        And there I find You in the mystery
        In oceans deep my faith will stand
        
        Chorus
        I will call upon Your Name
        And keep my eyes above the waves
        When oceans rise
        My soul will rest in Your embrace
        For I am Yours and You are mine
        
        Verse 2
        Your grace abounds in deepest waters
        Your sovereign hand will be my guide
        Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me
        You’ve never failed and You won’t start now
        
        Bridge
        Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
        Let me walk upon the waters
        Wherever You would call me
        Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
        And my faith will be made stronger
        In the presence of my Saviour
        
        Last Chorus
        I will call upon Your Name
        Keep my eyes above the waves
        My soul will rest in Your embrace
        I am Yours and You are mine</pre>
